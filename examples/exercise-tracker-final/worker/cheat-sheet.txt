This is a worker source code directory.
- You can add any kind of file here but only .js, .mjs, and .ts files may
contain source code.

After you make changes to your worker source code run:
$ estate worker boot
- This makes the worker live at the new version.

Generate client connection code to a live worker:
$ estate worker connect
- This works on npm-based projects housed in the '[projectRoot]/client' or
'[projectRoot]/clients/<name>' directories.

To list the live workers on your account:
$ estate worker list
